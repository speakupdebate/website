									In March 2022, Speak Up was created by high school debate
									students as a virtual spring break camp for 15 students in
									Maryland. Since then, Speak Up has reached 100+ elementary and
									middle school students through its summer debate programs. We
									hope to empower more students in our community through our
									coming winter, spring, and summer programs.

									The ability to deliver messages with confidence is a vital
									skill that can have an enormous impact on oneâ€™s success.
									Public speaking is useful in every area of life from personal
									to professional. Confidence along with strong public speaking
									skills help build leaders that this world needs.

									Speak Up is a non-profit run by experienced debaters and
									successful high school students that works to transform
									students into leaders. Through our free programs, we focus on
									helping students, regardless of experience, gain confidence in
									their speaking, persuasive, and researching abilities. We hope
									to empower students to find their voice.
